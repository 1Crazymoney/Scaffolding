ASP.NET MVC
===
ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.

ASP.NET MVC in ASP.NET vNext includes support for building web pages and HTTP services in a single aligned framework that can be hosted in IIS or self-hosted in your own process.

This project is part of ASP.NET vNext. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET vNext at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
